This module extends the functionality of base_queued_notify to allow to
schedule future notifications on a sale order when it reaches certain
state.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to Sales / Configuration / Sale Order Types.
2. On a sale order type form view, go to the notifications notebook and
   create a notification for that type. Have 3 sheets and models to
   choose, mail notifications, note notifications and activity
   notifications.
3. Fill the delay time, trigger state, and notification data.
4. The records that have a configured notification on its type, will
   queue a notification with the setted delay when the record reaches
   the setted trigger state.

This module only has one trigger state, confirmed sale orders. To add a
new one you have to create a new module that depends on this one.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

For time issues, this module has not been completed perfectly. Some
improvements have been listed in the base_queued_notify module.
